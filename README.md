I made this little demo using Node.js, socket.io, and Phonegap. It has three parts - the server (control.js), the controller (gyro.html running in a phonegap app), and the display (index.html). The display is meant to run on a desktop or laptop (or even a tablet), while the controller app runs on every time the server detects that a new phone has connected, it will add a new element to the display, and any number of android phones. that element will be controlled by that particular phone. I haven't tried this with more than one phone, but it should work (although performance will decrease with each added phone). Try it out, hack it up, and send me an email if you make something neat with it.
